## Learning Objectives
* Read data into tables
* Understanding metadata
* Manipulating data tables

You will be using data tables for just about everything the rest of the semester, so let warm-up today with exercise designed to review many of the basic table operations. And what could be better on a table than some breakfast cereal? We'll start by loading a data from a file.

To save you a lot of typing, there is a starter Jupyter notebook under "class activities." Open the one for class_06. At the start you are provided with metadata.

**Problem 1: In your own words, what is metadata?**

Recall that an array has to contain data of all the same type. Most of the data is numeric.

**Problem 2: Which columns contain an arrays of strings?**

Try extracting the rating data from the table.
```{python}
ratings = cereal.column("rating")
ratings
```

Now find the average rating.
