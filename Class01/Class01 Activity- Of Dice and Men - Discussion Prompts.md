# Class01 Activity: Of Dice and Men
## Differences in the Results
* Why aren’t all the averages the same, even though everyone used ‘fair’ dice?
* Is the “error” you see mostly about randomness or bias? How do you know?

Push them to articulate the distinction between random variability and systematic bias, even if they don’t use those words yet.

## Sample Size
* Do you think this variability is plausible given only 50 rolls?
* Can a result be surprising but still plausible?
* How many rolls is enough?
* Is there a point of diminishing returns?
* Would your answer change if we cared about the average vs. the probability of rolling a 12? Why?

They should realize “how many samples” depends on what question you’re asking — a subtle but crucial idea in data science.

## Rare Events
* If the expected number of 12s is about 1.4, what outcomes would actually surprise you?
* Is zero 12s surprising? Why or why not?
* 	What if we rolled 500 times instead of 50 — would zero 12s still be plausible?

## Evaluating the claim of unfair dice
* Suppose a classmate claims your dice are unfair, how do you test this?
* Could dice be unfair in a way this activity would not detect?

This is an introduction to hypothesis testing.

## Generalizing
Have a few students read their final sentence.

* Which of these statements would still be true if we changed the context from dice to polling, experiments, or climate data?
