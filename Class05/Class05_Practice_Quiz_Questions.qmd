## Learning Objectives
* Test your understanding
* Prepare for Quiz 1

This activity is practice for the first quiz. Do not use a Jupyter notebook. Answer the questions based on your programming experience. These are the types of questions that will be on the first Quiz. If you are stuck, talk with a team member. If you are *really* stuck, then try the code in a Jupyter notebook.

#### Problem 1: What is the output?
```{python}
# | output: false
a = "I'm not arguing."
b = "I'm just explaining why I'm right."
print(a + b)
```

#### Problem 2: What is the output?
```{python}
# | output: false
winter_months = ["December", "January", "February", "March"]
print(winter_months[3])
```
\vspace {1 cm}

#### Problem 3: What is the output?
```{python}
# | output: false
x = 2**3 / 8 + 3
print(x)
```
\vspace {1 cm}

#### Problem 4: What is the output?
```{python}
#| eval: false
# What do you call a fish with no eyes?
answer = "fish".replace("i","")
answer
```
\vspace {1 cm}


#### Problem 5: Explain the error.
```{python}
#| eval: false
my_tuple = ("Dr. Nyquist", "Geophysicist", "CST")
my_tuple[2] = "Earth & Environmental Science"
```
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
\vspace {1 cm}

#### Problem 6: What is the output?
```{python}
#| eval: false
import numpy as np
a = 3
b = 4
c = np.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
```
